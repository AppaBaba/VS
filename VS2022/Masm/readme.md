#MASM

One of the first things I always do when starting up a new Windows OS is run a few MASM programs just to see if Windows will run Assembly Code. Well doing it for every new Microsoft OS starting with the first IBM Personal Computer. At some point it seemed like MASM just went away all together. So, MASM has never gone away or will it ever. You can have as many layers of software as you want, but as some point you will need some machine code. It has never been a big deal to do, just was a little confusing when .net framework came into play. In saying that, I better make it clear that assembly language is not that easy to learn as other high-level languages are. I have already tested Windows 10 to death before I started using GitHub and I do not have a Windows 11 device yet. I also test MASM when I change to a new Visual Studio version. I have not done this on Visual Studio 2022 yet. This will also set me up for testing Windows 11 when I do get it. Soon, I hope. This old machine will not run Window 11.  Waiting for it to break down so I can get a new one. Will anyhow here is some Assembly Code
